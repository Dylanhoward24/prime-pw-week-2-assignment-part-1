    <h1>Week 2 Assignment - Part 1</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>How do you get a space between your first and last name when assigning
    the values firstName and lastName to fullName? I could never do a console
    log of fullName because it would just say DylanHoward. I would have to
    do a console log of separated firstName and lastName to get the space.
    Update: later on I found that I can do let fullName = firstName + " " +
    lastName and then I can just refer to fullName as the referenced variable!
    </p>
    <p>Is there a way to assign a true or false value to be shown as yes or
    no in the console log?</p>
